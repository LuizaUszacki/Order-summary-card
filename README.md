# Order summary card

## About the Website
This website is a challenge from FrontEnd Mentors.
It's a order summary card that uses flexbox and a little bit of display grid.
This project has hover on the 'buttons' and is responsive.
I also tried to make it a little more accessible.
It was built using HMTL and Scss.
